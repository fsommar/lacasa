/*
TODO: Split tell[T: Safe](T) and tell(Box[Any]) into two traits, for both Actor and ActorRef.
That way, an ActorRef to an Actor that only supports receiving safe messages, will only allow
sending those things. Feedback will be given at compile time, instead of keeping
track of it at runtime (by throwing exceptions).

If done correctly, it should allow for a very simple migration path from an existing Akka
application, given that 1) it uses the allowed subset of functionality and 2) it only sends
Safe types. However, if the user has objects that need to be send in boxes, then they can do
too, knowing that it will require more effort to migrate.

TODO: Make ActorAdapter work for the aforementioned two traits for Safe and Box actors,
and make sure the Banking example can be implemented using it.

TODO: Only support Ask pattern for Safe ActorRefs, i.e. enforce `sender` to only allow
sending safe messages, and likewise for the ask method. This should be handled on trait level.

TODO: Move Terminated et. al. to LaCasa actor namespace.
